# Face-Recognition-System-Using-OpenCV
Hello everyone, I'm visweswar reddy. To run this code, we have to download visual studios and have to install Desktop development with C++. The main reason to install visual studios is without it we cannot install dlib library which is useful for this code. After install Desktop development with c++, we have to install libraries like cmake, dlib, opencv, face recognition, numpy in our (command prompt or anaconda command prompt or in pycharm). I run this code in pycharm. 

To download those libraries in pycharm community:
  firstly we have to create a project, then
    have to click on "files" on top left corner,
    then settings,
    then project interpreter,
    and have to add libraries cmake,dlib, face recognition, numpy, opencv.
    
To install those libraries in command prompt or anaconda prompt:
   pip install cmake,
   pip install dlib,
   pip install face recognition,
   pip install numpy,
   pip install opencv.

 Thank you.
